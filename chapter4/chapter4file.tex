\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}  \label{conclusion}

They claim an elephant never forgets, but that is probably wrong. They
say the Internet never forgets, but that is also probably wrong. We
forget things all the time. In the future, I hope that future students
who pass on this template each leave at least one new elephant joke,
latex use example, or elephant citation to continue the field of Jumbo
Studies which is still in its infancy.
