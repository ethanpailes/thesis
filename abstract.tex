Each regular expresion corrisponds to a set of strings, or
language. Regular expression engines can be used to quickly decide
if a particular string is in that language and to
perform submatch extraction (parsing) on a regex containing
capture groups. While there has been significant work that focuses on either
deciding regular expressions or parsing them, to
the best of our knowledge no one has considered the
two problems separately. This thesis presents skip
regex, an engine for performing regular expression
parsing without considering the decision problem.
We show that this facilitates optimizations such as skipping
over sections of input or quickly scanning towards particular
literal strings, and argue through examples that the capability to parse
without deciding is a useful and applicable one, particularly
in the case of regular expressions where the performance
difference between DFAs and NFA simulations means that regex are
often currently decided twice in practice. While DFAs can decide
regular expressions quickly, they struggle to provide features
such as submatch extraction. Because of the difference in speed
of the two approaches, existing engines often first decide the input
with a DFA and then use an NFA to parse the matching subset of input.
Skip regex provide the to parse without deciding,
and provide a performance improvement even when the input must
be decided.
