Regular expression engines can be used to quickly decide a
regular language and to perform submatch extraction (parsing)
on a regex containing capture groups. While there
has been significant work that focuses on either
deciding regular expressions or parsing them, to
the best of our knowledge no one has considered the
two problems separately. This thesis presents skip
regex, an engine for performing regular expression
parsing without considering the decision problem.
We show that this facilitates significant optimization,
and argue though examples that the capability to parse
without deciding is a useful and applicable one, particularly
in the case of regular expressions where the performance
difference between DFAs and NFA simulations means that regex are
often currently decided twice in practice.
